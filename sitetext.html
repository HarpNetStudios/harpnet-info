<p>Hello, and welcome to this new site. If you are wondering, my webhost kicked me off of their service, so the entire site is now gone forever. :(</p>
<p>This will be the temporary home of HarpNet for now. Please bear with us, I am trying to scrape up enough money to get decent web hosting (I think I might rent a Google virtual machine.) and a domain (Man, domains that aren't .com's are super pricey these days.)</p>
<h3>Enjoy!</h3>
