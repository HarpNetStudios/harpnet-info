                Hello, and welcome to this new site. If you are wondering, my webhost kicked me off of their service, so the entire old site is now gone forever. :(
                This will be the temporary home of HarpNet for now. <b>We are almost ready to transfer to a real domain! Soon&trade;</b>
                Enjoy!

                We are HarpNet Studios, a game design company that makes games <sarcasm>(<b>*gasp*</b> NO WAY!)</sarcasm>
                Our goal is to make open source games for all to enjoy. If you like our stuff, please spread the word!
                That's what we do.

                Well, we want to make everyone happy!
                We love good games as much as any person and we hope to work with YOU on making our games great.
                Also, we all think open-source is the way to go for games.
                That's why we do it.

                All the places. No, really, HarpNet Studios has members from all around the globe.
                Most live in the United States, however some live as far away as the UK and beyond!
                Once I (Yellowberry) get enough money (It's always about the money, isn't it...) I plan to rent an office building.

                Thanks for reading! Please, do spread the word, it means a lot to us.
                In the future, I will have donations set up, but PayPal is annoying.
