                Hello, and welcome to this new site. If you are wondering, my webhost kicked me off of their service, so the entire old site is now gone forever. :(
                This will be the temporary home of HarpNet for now. <b>We are almost ready to transfer to a real domain! Soon&trade;</b>
                Enjoy!

                Also, we all think open-source is the way to go for games.

                All the places. No, really, HarpNet Studios has members from all around the globe.
                Most live in the United States, however some live as far away as the UK and beyond!
                Once I (Yellowberry) get enough money (It's always about the money, isn't it...) I plan to rent an office building.
