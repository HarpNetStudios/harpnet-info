                Hello, and welcome to this new site. If you are wondering,our webhost kicked me off of their service, so the entire old site is now gone forever. :(<BR />
                This will be the temporary home of HarpNet for now. <b>We are almost ready to transfer to a real domain! Soon&trade;</b><BR />
